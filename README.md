# Cancer Biomarkers from Clinical Data

This project presents a tutorial notebook that guides users through the identification of **cancer biomarkers** from clinical data, using the dataset `data\aar3247_cohen_sm_tables-s1-s11.xlsx` provided by [Cohen et al. (2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6063007/). Biomarkers play a critical role in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment evaluation, and this project provides step-by-step instructions on analyzing clinical datasets to identify them effectively.

The tutorial notebook is suitable for enthusiasts, students, and researchers in the field of bioinformatics and data science who want to explore biomarker discovery in cancer research.
